# 2020 Drastically Increased the Number of People on the Ontario Sunshine List

## An analysis of Ontario Public Sector’s “Highest” Earners

## Summary

-   The 2020 Ontario Sunshine List was released on March 19th 2021. It
    reported a total of 205,470 members, out of which 38,512 were new,
    or an increase of 23%.

-   While the list has expanded every year, this year’s growth was
    significantly larger than what the trend predicted.

-   Led by nurses and teachers, the higher-than-expected surge can be
    explained by a major compensation agreement in early 2020 and the
    government’s efforts to combat the pandemic.

## This Report

[This report](https://github.com/ricardochejfec/BreakingDown_OSL20/blob/main/Report.md) is a descriptive analysis of the Ontario Sunshine List. The
main section is my attempt to shed some light on the effects of 2020 on
Ontario’s high earners. Appendix A considers what would happen if the
list’s cut-off salary was adjusted for inflation and Appendix B includes
other descriptive statistics that were not relevant to the research
question. The project is intended to be fully reproducible.
